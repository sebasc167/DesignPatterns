# DesignPatterns

This repo will be used as a way to practice applications of the design patterns. There are many behavioral, structural, and creational design patterns that will be used in this repository and the examples are written in C#. There will also be documentation that explains all the different design patterns and where we could apply them. Of course there are more but I included some of the most important patterns so check out those word documents in the documentation folder when I add.
There is a folder structure you must be aware of:
- src
  - Behavioral
  - Creational
  - Structural
- tests
  - Behavioral.Unit.Tests
  - Creational.Unit.Tests 
  - Structural.Unit.Tests
- documentation
